# Scoreboard Chat Hack for Bukkit

This is a simple chat layer which reenables Vanilla-style chat in relation to scoreboards. This would mean any sort of coloration or any other modifications to a username that would appear in chat, and is necessary as Bukkit does not support simple chat for this modification.

### Installation

Just put the jar in the plugins folder. There's no config.yml for this.
